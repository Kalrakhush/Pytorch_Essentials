# 🧠 PyTorch Essentials

Welcome to **PyTorch Essentials** – a hands-on, concept-to-code journey through deep learning using PyTorch.

This repository is a personal learning journal and project space where I’ve explored:

## 🔍 What's Inside?

### 1. **Math & ML Foundations**
- Implementations of machine learning models **from scratch** using NumPy.
- Linear regression, gradient descent, and loss minimization – manually coded to understand the math behind the magic.

### 2. **Core PyTorch Concepts**
- Tensors, Autograd, and the computational graph.
- Building neural networks with `torch.nn` and training them with `optim`.

### 3. **CNNs & Image Classification**
- Implementing Convolutional Neural Networks for image tasks.
- Working with datasets, data loaders, and augmentations.

### 4. **RNNs**
- Sequence modeling using Recurrent Neural Networks.

### 5. **PyTorch Lightning**
- Refactoring models for cleaner, scalable training using PyTorch Lightning.

### 6. **Projects**
- Capstone mini-projects applying learned concepts on real-world datasets.
